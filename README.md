# Smart-Espresso-Scale
Digitalized Espresso scale 

A 5-Kg Load Sensor is interfaced with 8052 8-Bit MC. Several measurements are taken and displayed via 2x8 LCD Screen. 32-Bit 
arithmetic operations are performed.

## Features
>Automated Tare Function:

Initiated at the simple touch of a button. Measurements taken afterwards now exclude the mass of the container placed on 
the load scale. If, however, the container is replaced, MC senses the change in mass and act accordingly. In other words, 
tare function might be terminated if the container placed on the scale is later removed. 

>Smart Watch Dog Timer

Espresso brewers seek consistency in their coffee. One way to ensure that is to have a constant flow of espresso drip within 
a predetermined time period. In particular, 30 seconds of coffee brew time is generally preferred. A smart timer is embedded 
in the MC. The MC unit detects the constant flow of coffee and starts the timer accordingly. When the flow is stopped, timer 
stops counting. In other words, timer is initiated automatically so that coffee enthusiast may focus on some other thins dur-
ing the brew time. 

>Increments

32-BIT operations ensured the accuracy in mathematical operations and no significant figures are lost during the process of 
calculations. This way, 8052 MC unit has become able to read increments as low as 1gr. 

>Feature Work

A Bluetooth interface is implemented in the design with the intention of sending the data to a computer or a smart-phone. The 
data sent to the computer may then be processed to have variety of plots with respect to time, mass distribution during the 
brew time, etc.
